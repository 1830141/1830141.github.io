					<h4>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Hall</h4>
					<p class="nice-p">Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, will talk about how the floods inspired her artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost, her work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered.</p>

					<h3>Ice Sculptures</h3>
